I am interested in developing mathematical models to study the dynamics of the acute inflammatory response. 
Ordinary and partial differential equations are frequentely used to develop such models. Numerical and analytical analysis of these models provide a rich inside of the biolog of the problem. We often require parameter estimation techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares, Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) algorithms, and variations of these such as Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM)  to study animal and human data.  

### Mathematical Modeling of Energy Consumption in the Acute Inflammatory Response.

* Several studies have shown a relation between sepsis and low levels of ATP combined with overproduction of Lactate and Nitric Oxide. In this project we developed a system of ordinary differential equations to study the dynamics of the acute inflammatory response and its interations with the production and consumption of ATP.
