I am interested in developing mathematical models to study the dynamics of the acute inflammatory response. 
Ordinary and partial differential equations are frequentely used to develop such models. Analytic and numerical explorations such as bifurcation analysis of these models provide a rich inside of the biology of the problem. We often require parameter estimation techniques such as Ordinary Least Squares, Monte Carlo Markov Chains (MCMC) algorithms, and variations of these like Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis (DRAM) to fit these models to animal and human data.  
I am also interested in implementing optimal control to our models to find ideal treatment strategies to fight infectious diseases.  

### Mathematical Modeling of Energy Consumption in the Acute Inflammatory Response.

* Several studies have shown a relation between sepsis and low levels of ATP combined with overproduction of Lactate and Nitric Oxide. In this project we developed a system of ordinary differential equations to study the dynamics of the acute inflammatory response and its interations with the production and consumption of ATP.
