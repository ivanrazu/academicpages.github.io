I am originally from Costa Rica from where I finished my undergraduate studies at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). Currently, I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh. My work focuses on developing mathematical models of inflammation and immune response. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~rubin/) and [Dr. David Swigon](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~swigon/). We also collaborate with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](http://www.ccm.pitt.edu/directory/profile/gilles-clermont). 

I am interested in studying the dynamics of infectious and non infectious deseases. In particular I have work modeling the dynamics of the acute immune response to sepsis. I am also interested in parameter estimation, biffurcation analysis, numerical methods and optimal control.
