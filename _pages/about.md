I am originally from Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). I completed a Masters in Mathematics at [East Tennessee State University](http://www.etsu.edu/ehome/).  Later, I obtained my PhD in Mathematics at [University of Pittsburgh](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/) where I worked under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~rubin/) and [Dr. David Swigon](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~swigon/) and we also collaborated with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](http://www.ccm.pitt.edu/directory/profile/gilles-clermont).

Currently, I am a postdoctoral fellow at University of Tennessee Health Science Center working under the direction of [Dr. Amber Smith] (https://ambersmithlab.com/). 
My area of research focuses in the development of mathematical models to study the underlying dynamics of problems arising from immunology, oncology, epidemiology, population dynamics, infectious diseases, and many other areas of the life sciences. More specifically, I have been working on modeling the energy demands and consumption in the acute inflammatory response.

I am interested in mathematical immunology, bioenergetics, modeling infectious diseases, optimal control, ordinary and partial differential equations, dynamical systems, epidemiology, population dynamics, mathematical oncology, and parameter estimation techniques.
