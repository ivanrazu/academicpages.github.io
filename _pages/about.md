I am originally from Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Mathematics department at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/). My area of research focuses on developing and studying mathematical models to explore the dynamics of the acute immune response under the presence of certain diseases and conditions. 

I work under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~rubin/) and [Dr. David Swigon](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~swigon/) and we also collaborate with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](http://www.ccm.pitt.edu/directory/profile/gilles-clermont). 

I am interested in mathematical immunology, bioenergetics, modeling infectious diseases, optimal control, differential equations, epidemiology, and parameter estimation techniques.
