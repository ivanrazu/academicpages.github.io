I am originally from Costa Rica from where I finished my undergraduate studies at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Mathematics department at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/). My area of research focuses on developing mathematical models of the acute inflammatory response to fight an infection. I work under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~rubin/) and [Dr. David Swigon](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~swigon/). We also collaborate with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](http://www.ccm.pitt.edu/directory/profile/gilles-clermont). 

I am also interested in ordinary differential equations, parameter estimation, biffurcation analysis, and optimal control.
