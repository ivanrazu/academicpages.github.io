I am originally from Costa Rica where I completed my undergraduate studies in Mathematics at [Universidad de Costa Rica](https://www.ucr.ac.cr/). Currently, I am a PhD student in the [Mathematics department at the University of Pittsburgh](https://www.mathematics.pitt.edu/). My area of research focuses on developing and studying mathematical models to explore the dynamics of certain diseases and conditions. In particular, the acute inflammatory response and the factors that may be related to sepsis. 

I work under the supervision of [Dr. Jonathan Rubin](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~rubin/) and [Dr. David Swigon](http://www.math.pitt.edu/~swigon/) and we also collaborate with [Dr. Gilles Clermont](http://www.ccm.pitt.edu/directory/profile/gilles-clermont). 

I am interested in mathematical immunology, bioenergetics, modeling infectious diseases, optimal control, differential equations, epidemiology, and parameter estimation techniques. 

I enjoy watching and playing soccer, salsa dance and spending time with my wife. Also I was part of the Costa Rican National Bridge team in [2008-2009]((http://www.worldbridge.org/person/?qryid=27480)). We participated in a couple international competions including the first
[World Mind Sports Games in 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2008_World_Mind_Sports_Games) in Beijing and the [First world youth congress] in Istanbul 2009(http://db.worldbridge.org/Repository/tourn/Istanbul.09/Istanbul.htm).
