I am originally from Costa Rica. Currently I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh. My work focuses on developing mathematical models of inflammation and immune response. I work under the supervision of Dr. Jonathan Rubin and Dr. David Swigon. And we collaborate with Dr. Gilles Clermont. 
I am interested in studying the dynamics of infectious and non infectious deseases.
